num1 = int(input("enter your first number please: "))
num2 = int(input("enter your second number please: "))
num3 = int(input("enter your third number please"))

print("If you ADD the numbers, you'll get:")
print(num1 + num2)

print("If you SUBTRACT the numbers, you'll get:")
print(num1 - num2)

print("If you MULTIPLY the numbers, you'll get:")
